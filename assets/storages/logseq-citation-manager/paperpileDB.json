The mortality and morbidity associated with the overt form of hepatic encephalopathy are high, and even the covert form associates with poor outcomes and poor quality of life. We know that the dysfunction is not just an acute insult to the brain but rather results in long-standing cognitive issues that get worse with each episode of HE. Hence, there is an urgency to accurately diagnose these conditions, start appropriate therapy, and to maintain remission. Currently, we have two mainstay pharmacological treatment options (lactulose and rifaximin), but the narrative is evolving with new therapies under trial.

(TACE) is a widely used treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), combining targeted chemotherapy and embolization. While effective, TACE can be associated with significant gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, impacting a patient’s quality of life. Objectives: Quantify the prevalence of key GI complications (diarrhea, nausea, GI toxicity, abdominal pain) following TACE. Design: Systematic review was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, focusing on studies that reported side effects of TACE. Studies not involving cTACE or drug-eluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE), non-HCC studies, meta-analyses or systematic reviews, and inaccessible publications were excluded. Data sources and methods: A PubMed search for clinical and randomized trials was conducted. Extracted data included study identifiers, demographics, TACE details, and GI side effect prevalences. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool assessed study quality and bias. Results: The analysis included data from 81 studies with 121 individual study arms and 9495 patients. Diarrhea was reported in 38 studies, with a mean prevalence of 23.46% (2.5; 95% confidence interval (CI): 18.39–28.544) and a weighted prevalence of 23.5%. Nausea was most frequently reported, mentioned in 67 studies, with a mean prevalence of 34.66% (2.4; 95% CI: 29.89–39.44) and a weighted prevalence of 32.5%. Abdominal pain was reported in 59 studies, with the highest mean prevalence of 48.07% (2.9; 95% CI: 42.20–53.93) and a weighted prevalence of 46.1%. GI toxicity was reported in 32 studies, with a mean prevalence of 8.85% (1.4; 95% CI: 5.99–11.70) and a weighted prevalence of 9.9%. DEB-TACE generally led to slightly higher rates of nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and GI toxicity compared to conventional TACE. The type of chemotherapy agent influenced prevalence of GI-side effects, with high prevalences observed for agents such as zinostatin and cisplatin. Conclusion: This meta-analysis synthesizes current evidence on managing GI side effects in TACE. Standardizing reporting and developing effective management strategies are crucial to improving patient outcomes."],"author":["Arendt, Nathalie","Kopsida, Maria","Khaled, Jaafar","Sjöblom, Markus","Heindryckx, Femke"],"date":["2025-06-01"],"doi":["10.1177/17588359251316663"],"file":["/home/psira/Zotero/storage/5ZRI8EZ3/Arendt et al. - 2025 - Gastrointestinal side effects in hepatocellular carcinoma patients receiving transarterial chemoembo.pdf"],"issn":["1758-8359"],"journaltitle":["Therapeutic Advances in Medical Oncology"],"pages":["17588359251316663"],"publisher":["SAGE Publications Ltd STM"],"shortjournal":["Ther Adv Med Oncol"],"shorttitle":["Gastrointestinal side effects in hepatocellular carcinoma patients receiving transarterial chemoembolization"],"title":["Gastrointestinal side effects in hepatocellular carcinoma patients receiving transarterial chemoembolization: A meta-analysis of 81 studies and 9495 patients"],"url":["https://doi.org/10.1177/17588359251316663"],"urldate":["2025-06-08"],"volume":["17"],"year":["2025"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Arendt","firstName":"Nathalie"},{"lastName":"Kopsida","firstName":"Maria"},{"lastName":"Khaled","firstName":"Jaafar"},{"lastName":"Sjöblom","firstName":"Markus"},{"lastName":"Heindryckx","firstName":"Femke"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"artalOpticsEyeIts2014","type":"article","fields":{"langid":["english"],"abstract":["The human eye is a relatively simple optical instrument.

Methods. In a prospective cohort study, the CT data of consecutive 250 adults with healthy eyes were collected and analyzed, and sagittal, transverse, and axial diameters of both eyeballs were measured. The data obtained from the left eye and from the right eye were compared. The correlation analysis was performed with the following variables: orbit size, gender, age, and ethnic background. Results. We did not find statistically significant differences correlated with gender of the patients and their age. The right eyeball was slightly smaller than the left one but this difference was statistically insignificant (P = 0.17). We did not find statistically significant differences of the eyeball sizes among the ethnicities we dealt with. Strong correlation was found between the transverse diameter and the width of the orbit (r = 0.88). Conclusion. The size of a human adult eye is approximately 24.2 mm (transverse) × 23.7 mm (sagittal) × 22.0–24.8 mm (axial) with no significant difference between sexes and age groups. In the transverse diameter, the eyeball size may vary from 21 mm to 27 mm.

The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system is widely accepted and has recently undergone updates with the introduction of new systemic therapies and stage migration.The treatment of patients with HCC should involve a multidisciplinary approach with collaboration among surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and interventional radiologists to provide optimal care. Treatment paradigms must consider both tumor and patient-related factors such as extent of liver disease, which is a main driver of morbidity and mortality.

The incidence of HCC is on the rise in Thailand, where it has become the most common malignancy in males and the third most common in females. Here, we review some of the risk factors that have contributed to this increase in HCC incidence in the Thai population. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the main etiologic risk factor for HCC, followed by hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients with HBV genotype C have a higher positive rate of hepatitis B early antigen (HBeAg) and progress to cirrhosis and HCC earlier than genotype B. For HCV patients, 16% developed HCC associated cirrhosis by year 5 after diagnosis, and the cumulative risk for death from HCC at year 10 was 60%. Dietary exposure to the fungal hepatocarcinogen aflatoxin B1 has been shown to interact synergistically with HBV infection to increase the risk of early onset HCC. Chronic alcohol abuse remains an important risk factor for malignant transformation of hepatocytes, frequently in association with alcohol-induced cirrhosis.

Currently, there is no data available about the time course and pattern of presentation for stones retained in the CBD at the time of LC. The aim of this study was to establish the time course and pattern of presentation of unsuspected retained CBD stones post LC. Methods Patients presenting with symptomatic CBD stones from 1994 until 2010, having previously undergone LC were studied in this retrospective, case note review. CBD stones were confirmed at ERCP. Data collected included LC date, mode of presentation, imaging results including CBD diameter, stone appearance, length of stay and post ERCP complications. Patients having an ERCP for stones found on IOC at LC were excluded. Results Sixty-one patients met the inclusion criteria. The most common mode of presentation was abdominal pain (n = 38, 62 %) with (17) or without (21) deranged liver function tests. Nineteen (31 %) patients presented with clinical complications of the CBD stones: cholangitis (10), acute biliary pancreatitis (6) or obstructive jaundice (3). The CBD was usually mild-to-moderately dilated (8–15 mm) on ultrasound. The median time span from LC to presentation with CBD stones was 4 years (range: 6 days–18 years). Five (8.2 %) patients had a complication from their ERCP; mild pancreatitis (3), bleed (1) and cholangitis (1). Nineteen (31.1 %) patients required more than one ERCP to complete stone/stent removal. Conclusions The median time for patients to present with symptomatic CBD stones after LC is 4 years. Patients with retrained stones may remain asymptomatic for many years. A third of the patients presented with potentially serious complications of the retained CBD stone. Future studies for CBD stones after LC need to follow patients for at least 10 years."],"author":["Cox, Michael R.","Budge, Joel P.

Acute cholecystitis is diagnosed in approximately 200 000 people in the US each year.</p><h3>Observations</h3><p>Gallstone-associated cystic duct obstruction is responsible for 90% to 95% of the cases of acute cholecystitis. Approximately 5% to 10% of patients with acute cholecystitis have<i>acalculous cholecystitis</i>, defined as acute inflammation of the gallbladder without gallstones, typically in the setting of severe critical illness. The typical presentation of acute cholecystitis consists of acute right upper quadrant pain, fever, and nausea that may be associated with eating and physical examination findings of right upper quadrant tenderness. Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant has a sensitivity of approximately 81% and a specificity of approximately 83% for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. When an ultrasound result does not provide a definitive diagnosis, hepatobiliary scintigraphy (a nuclear medicine study that includes the intravenous injection of a radiotracer excreted in the bile) is the gold standard diagnostic test. Following diagnosis, early (performed within 1-3 days) vs late (performed after 3 days) laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with improved patient outcomes, including fewer composite postoperative complications (11.8% for early vs 34.4% for late), a shorter length of hospital stay (5.4 days vs 10.0 days), and lower hospital costs. During pregnancy, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy, compared with delayed operative management, is associated with a lower risk of maternal-fetal complications (1.6% for early vs 18.4% for delayed) and is recommended during all trimesters. In people older than 65 years of age, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with lower mortality at 2-year follow-up (15.2%) compared with nonoperative management (29.3%). A percutaneous cholecystostomy tube, in which a drainage catheter is placed in the gallbladder lumen under image guidance, is an effective therapy for patients with an exceptionally high perioperative risk. However, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement in a randomized trial was associated with higher rates of postprocedural complications (65%) compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (12%). For patients with acalculous acute cholecystitis, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube should be reserved for patients who are severely ill at the time of diagnosis; all others should undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Acute cholecystitis, typically due to gallstone obstruction of the cystic duct, affects approximately 200 000 people in the US annually. In most patient populations, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, performed within 3 days of diagnosis, is the first-line therapy for acute cholecystitis.</p>"],"author":["Gallaher, Jared R.","Charles, Anthony"],"date":["2022-03-08"],"doi":["10.1001/jama.2022.2350"],"file":["/home/psira/Zotero/storage/3FSTTBPH/Gallaher and Charles - 2022 - Acute Cholecystitis A Review.pdf"],"issn":["0098-7484"],"journaltitle":["JAMA"],"number":["10"],"pages":["965–975"],"publisher":["American Medical Association"],"shortjournal":["JAMA"],"shorttitle":["Acute Cholecystitis"],"title":["Acute Cholecystitis: A Review"],"url":["https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2789654"],"urldate":["2025-06-07"],"volume":["327"],"year":["2022"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Gallaher","firstName":"Jared R."},{"lastName":"Charles","firstName":"Anthony"}]}},{"key":"goodUltrasonicPropertiesGallstones1979","type":"article","fields":{"author":["Good, L.","Edell, S.","Soloway, R.","Trotman, B.","Mulhern, C.","Arger, P."],"date":["1979-08-01"],"doi":["10.1016/0016-5085(79)90274-9"],"journaltitle":["Gastroenterology"],"pages":["258–263"],"shortjournal":["Gastroenterology"],"title":["Ultrasonic properties of gallstones: Effect of stone size and composition"],"url":["https://consensus.app/papers/ultrasonic-properties-of-gallstones-effect-of-stone-size-good-edell/f73756c95f5a5dada6f21790c1738bea/"],"volume":["77"],"year":["1979"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Good","firstName":"L."},{"lastName":"Edell","firstName":"S."},{"lastName":"Soloway","firstName":"R."},{"lastName":"Trotman","firstName":"B."},{"lastName":"Mulhern","firstName":"C."},{"lastName":"Arger","firstName":"P."}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"grzybowskiRecentDevelopmentsCataract2020","type":"article","fields":{"langid":["english"],"author":["Grzybowski, Andrzej"],"date":["2020-11"],"doi":["10.21037/atm-2020-rcs-16"],"eprint":["33313285"],"eprinttype":["pubmed"],"file":["/home/psira/Zotero/storage/YNUGVR5K/Grzybowski - 2020 - Recent developments in cataract surgery.pdf;/home/psira/Zotero/storage/5F7SIXTN/PMC7729366.html"],"journaltitle":["Annals of Translational Medicine"],"number":["22"],"publisher":["AME Publications"],"title":["Recent developments in cataract surgery"],"url":["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7729366/"],"urldate":["2024-07-11"],"volume":["8"],"year":["2020"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Grzybowski","firstName":"Andrzej"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"hadjihambiHepaticEncephalopathyCritical2018","type":"article","fields":{"langid":["english"],"abstract":["Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a serious neuropsychiatric complication of cirrhosis and/or porto-systemic shunting.

In the past 20–30 years, there has been rapid progress in understanding the pathophysiological basis of HE; however, the lack of direct correlation between pathogenic factors and the severity of HE make it difficult to select appropriate therapy for HE patients. In this review, we will discuss the classification system and its limitations, the neuropsychometric assessments and their challenges, as well as the present knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms. Despite the many prevalent hypotheses around the pathogenesis of the disease, most treatments focus on targeting and lowering the accumulation of ammonia as well as inflammation. However, treatment of minimal HE remains a huge unmet need and a big concerted effort is needed to better define this condition to allow the development of new therapies.

Given the importance of the RPE for optimal retinal function, RD invariably leads to decreased vision. There are three main types of RD: rhegmatogenous, tractional and exudative (also termed serous) RD. In rhegmatogenous RD, one or more retinal breaks enable vitreous fluid to enter the subretinal space and separate the neurosensory retina from the RPE. In tractional RD, preretinal, intraretinal or subretinal membranes contract and exert tangential forces and elevate the retina from the underlying RPE. Finally, in exudative RD, an underlying inflammatory condition, vascular abnormality or the presence of a tumour causes exudative fluid to accumulate in the subretinal space, exceeding the osmotic pump function of the RPE. The surgical management of RD usually involves pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling or pneumatic retinopexy. The approach taken often depends on patient characteristics as well as on practitioner experience and clinical judgement. Advances in surgical technology and continued innovation have improved outcomes for many patients. However, even if retinal re-attachment is achieved, some patients still experience decreased vision or other visual symptoms, such as metamorphopsia, that diminish their quality of life.

We analyzed 56 sets of common bile duct gallstones collected over a 10-yr period using infrared and atomic absorption spectroscopy and chemical methods. Twenty-four sets (43%) of stones were cholesterol stones containing 85.3% cholesterol, 3.2% pigment, 0.6% phosphate, and 1.3% total calcium. Ten sets (18%) were black pigment stones containing 36.5% pigment, 11.4% cholesterol, 7.6% carbonate, 3.0% phosphate, and 6.2% total calcium. Twenty-two sets (39%) were brown pigment stones containing 52.7% pigment, 16.5% calcium palmitate, 10.1% cholesterol, 0.4% phosphate, and 3.4% total calcium. Most of the 26 stones found at the same time as or within several months after cholecystectomy were either cholesterol (69%) or black pigment (19%). In contrast, the majority (59%) of the 22 common duct stones that were diagnosed greater than or equal to 21 mo after cholecystectomy were brown pigment stones. In conclusion, brown pigment stones are a distinct type of pigment stone characterized by their content of substantial amounts of calcium palmitate. They comprise a significant proportion of common duct stones in this series of United States patients, particularly of those found greater than or equal to 21 mo after cholecystectomy."],"author":["Malet, P.

If the case is judged to be urgent, initial medical treatment should be started immediately including respiratory/circulatory management if required, without waiting for a definitive diagnosis. The patient's medical history is then taken; an abdominal examination is performed; blood tests, urinalysis, and diagnostic imaging are carried out; and a diagnosis is made using the diagnostic criteria for cholangitis/cholecystitis. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, initial medical treatment should be started immediately, severity should be assessed according to the severity grading criteria for acute cholangitis/cholecystitis, and the patient's general status should be evaluated. For mild acute cholangitis, in most cases initial treatment including antibiotics is sufficient, and most patients do not require biliary drainage. However, biliary drainage should be considered if a patient does not respond to initial treatment. For moderate acute cholangitis, early endoscopic or percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage is indicated. If the underlying etiology requires treatment, this should be provided after the patient's general condition has improved; endoscopic sphincterotomy and subsequent choledocholithotomy may be performed together with biliary drainage.

Common causes of cholangitis (eg, gallstones, benign and malignant biliary strictures) are well known. However, others (eg, immunoglobulin-G subclass-4–related sclerosing cholangitis) have been described only recently, are still under evaluation, and need to gain broader attention from clinicians. The diagnosis of acute cholangitis is based on clinical presentation and laboratory data indicating systemic infection, as well as diagnostic imaging modalities revealing signs of biliary obstruction and possibly an underlying etiology. The clinical presentation varies, and initial risk stratification is important to guide further management. Early medical therapy, including fluid resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic coverage, is of major importance in all cases, followed by a biliary drainage procedure and, if possible, definitive therapy of the underlying etiology. The type and timing of biliary drainage should be based on the severity of the clinical presentation, and the availability and feasibility of drainage techniques, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), and open surgical drainage. ERCP plays a central role in the management of biliary obstruction in patients with acute cholangitis.

This retrospective cohort study aimed to identify whether ECOG‐PS scores rated by oncologist versus nurses differ in their ability to predict clinical outcomes.Over 19 months, 32 oncologists and 41 chemotherapy nurses from a single academic comprehensive cancer center independently scored ECOG‐PS (range: 0–5) for a random sample of 311 patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. Logistic regression models were fit to evaluate the ability of nurse and physician ECOG‐PS scores, as well as the nurse‐physician ECOG‐PS score difference (nurse minus physician), to predict the occurrence of chemotherapy toxicity (CTCAE v4, grade ≥3) and hospitalizations within 1 month from ECOG‐PS ratings, as well as 6‐month mortality or hospice referrals.Physician/nurse ECOG‐PS agreement was 71% (Cohen's κ = 0.486, p &lt; .0001). Nurse ECOG‐PS scores had stronger odds ratio for 6‐month mortality or hospice (odds ratio [OR], 3.29, p &lt; .0001) than physician ECOG‐PS scores (OR, 2.71, p = .001). Furthermore, ECOG‐PS ratings by nurses, but not physicians, correlated with 1‐month chemotherapy toxicity (OR, 1.44, p = .021) and 1‐month hospitalizations (OR, 1.57, p = .041). Nurse‐physician disagreement, but only when physicians gave “healthier” (lower) ratings, was also associated with worse outcomes (chemotherapy toxicity OR = 1.51, p = .045; 1‐month hospitalization OR, 1.86, p = .037; 6‐month mortality or hospice OR, 2.99, p &lt; .0001).Nurse ECOG‐PS ratings seem more predictive of important outcomes than those of physicians, and physician‐nurse disagreement in ECOG‐PS ratings predicts worse outcomes; scoring by nurses may result in additional clinical benefit.Nurse‐rated Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG‐PS) scores, compared with those rated by oncologists, better predicted hospitalizations and severe chemotherapy toxicity within 1 month from ECOG‐PS assessment, as well as mortality or hospice referrals within 6 months. Physician‐nurse disagreement in ECOG‐PS scoring was associated with worse hospitalization, chemotherapy toxicity, and mortality and hospice referral rates.

While viral hepatitis and liver fluke infections have been associated with HCC and iCCA, respectively, other environmental risk factors, overall risk factor commonality and combinatorial roles, and effects on survival have not been systematically examined. We conducted a TIGER-LC consortium-based population study covering all high-incidence areas of both malignancies across Thailand: 837 HCC, 1474 iCCA, and 1112 controls (2011–2019) were comprehensively queried on lifelong environmental exposures, lifestyle, and medical history. Multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to evaluate risk factors and associated survival patterns. Our models identified shared risk factors between HCC and iCCA, such as viral hepatitis infection, liver fluke infection, and diabetes, including novel and shared associations of agricultural pesticide exposure (OR range of 1.50; 95% CI: 1.06–2.11 to 2.91; 95% CI: 1.82–4.63) along with vulnerable sources of drinking water. Most patients had multiple risk factors, magnifying their risk considerably. Patients with lower risk levels had better survival in both HCC (HR 0.78; 95% CI: 0.64–0.96) and iCCA (HR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.70–0.99). Risk factor co-exposures and their common associations with HCC and iCCA in Thailand emphasize the importance for future prevention and control measures, especially in its large agricultural sector. The observed mortality patterns suggest ways to stratify patients for anticipated survivorship and develop plans to support medical care of longer-term survivors, including behavioral changes to reduce exposures."],"author":["Pupacdi, Benjarath","Loffredo, Christopher A.","Budhu, Anuradha","Rabibhadana, Siritida","Bhudhisawasdi, Vajarabhongsa","Pairojkul, Chawalit","Sukeepaisarnjaroen, Wattana","Pugkhem, Ake","Luvira, Vor","Lertprasertsuke, Nirush","Chotirosniramit, Anon","Auewarakul, Chirayu U.","Ungtrakul, Teerapat","Sricharunrat, Thaniya","Sangrajrang, Suleeporn","Phornphutkul, Kannika","Albert, Paul S.","Kim, Sungduk","Harris, Curtis C.","Mahidol, Chulabhorn","Wang, Xin Wei","Ruchirawat, Mathuros","Consortium, the TIGER-LC"],"date":["2024"],"doi":["10.1002/ijc.35034"],"file":["/home/psira/Zotero/storage/IWVBIGLR/Pupacdi et al. - 2024 - The landscape of etiological patterns of hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinom.pdf;/home/psira/Zotero/storage/GE8PDWB7/ijc.html"],"issn":["1097-0215"],"journaltitle":["International Journal of Cancer"],"keywords":["case–control study","hepatocellular carcinoma","intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma","risk factors","Thailand"],"number":["8"],"pages":["1387–1399"],"title":["The landscape of etiological patterns of hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in Thailand"],"url":["https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ijc.35034"],"urldate":["2025-06-08"],"volume":["155"],"year":["2024"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Pupacdi","firstName":"Benjarath"},{"lastName":"Loffredo","firstName":"Christopher A."},{"lastName":"Budhu","firstName":"Anuradha"},{"lastName":"Rabibhadana","firstName":"Siritida"},{"lastName":"Bhudhisawasdi","firstName":"Vajarabhongsa"},{"lastName":"Pairojkul","firstName":"Chawalit"},{"lastName":"Sukeepaisarnjaroen","firstName":"Wattana"},{"lastName":"Pugkhem","firstName":"Ake"},{"lastName":"Luvira","firstName":"Vor"},{"lastName":"Lertprasertsuke","firstName":"Nirush"},{"lastName":"Chotirosniramit","firstName":"Anon"},{"lastName":"Auewarakul","firstName":"Chirayu U."},{"lastName":"Ungtrakul","firstName":"Teerapat"},{"lastName":"Sricharunrat","firstName":"Thaniya"},{"lastName":"Sangrajrang","firstName":"Suleeporn"},{"lastName":"Phornphutkul","firstName":"Kannika"},{"lastName":"Albert","firstName":"Paul S."},{"lastName":"Kim","firstName":"Sungduk"},{"lastName":"Harris","firstName":"Curtis C."},{"lastName":"Mahidol","firstName":"Chulabhorn"},{"lastName":"Wang","firstName":"Xin Wei"},{"lastName":"Ruchirawat","firstName":"Mathuros"},{"lastName":"Consortium","firstName":"the TIGER-LC"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"riordan-evaVaughanAsburysGeneral2008","type":"book","fields":{"langid":["english"],"author":["Riordan-Eva, Paul","Whitcher, John","Vaughan, Daniel","Asbury, Taylor"],"date":["2008"],"eprint":["0Qxnuj3MIUgC"],"eprinttype":["googlebooks"],"isbn":["978-0-07-137831-4"],"pagetotal":["490"],"publisher":["McGraw Hill Professional"],"title":["Vaughan & Asbury's general ophthalmology"],"year":["2008"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Riordan-Eva","firstName":"Paul"},{"lastName":"Whitcher","firstName":"John"},{"lastName":"Vaughan","firstName":"Daniel"},{"lastName":"Asbury","firstName":"Taylor"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"sangroTransarterialChemoembolizationRadioembolization2014","type":"article","fields":{"langid":["english"],"abstract":["<p>Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radioembolization (RE) are frequently used to treat patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who cannot receive curative therapies.

Moderately severe acute pancreatitis with fluid and/or necrotic collections causes substantial morbidity, and severe disease with persistent organ failure causes significant mortality. The diagnosis requires two of upper abdominal pain, amylase/lipase ≥ 3 ×upper limit of normal, and/or cross-sectional imaging findings. Gallstones and ethanol predominate while hypertriglyceridaemia and drugs are notable among many causes. Serum triglycerides, full blood count, renal and liver function tests, glucose, calcium, transabdominal ultrasound, and chest imaging are indicated, with abdominal cross-sectional imaging if there is diagnostic uncertainty. Subsequent imaging is undertaken to detect complications, for example, if C-reactive protein exceeds 150 mg/L, or rarer aetiologies. Pancreatic intracellular calcium overload, mitochondrial impairment, and inflammatory responses are critical in pathogenesis, targeted in current treatment trials, which are crucially important as there is no internationally licenced drug to treat acute pancreatitis and prevent complications. Initial priorities are intravenous fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and enteral nutrition, and when necessary, critical care and organ support, parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, pancreatic exocrine and endocrine replacement therapy; all may have adverse effects. Patients with local complications should be referred to specialist tertiary centres to guide further management, which may include drainage and/or necrosectomy.

Participants All ophthalmic ambulatory procedures performed from 2012 to 2014. Methods The State Ambulatory Surgery Databases (SASD), a collection of data from 29 participating states that represent two-thirds of the U.S. population, were used for analysis. All ophthalmic procedures performed in ambulatory settings from 2012 to 2014 were included. Incidence and demographics for each procedure were assessed, with descriptive statistics determined to highlight key differences in epidemiology and patient characteristics for each procedure. Population-based rates of procedures for each racial group were calculated using national census data. Results Over a period of 3 years, 3 934 004 ophthalmic procedures were performed, with majority being ambulatory (98.5%). Most common procedures were lens and cataract removal (66.5%), followed by intraocular procedures (11.4%) and procedures involving eyelids, cornea, and conjunctiva (8.2%). All ambulatory procedures had a higher number of female patients except retinal tear and detachment repairs (male patients, 59.4%). Most procedures had a higher rate in blacks compared with whites and other races, and Medicare was the most common mode of payment. Conclusions Approximately 1.3 million ambulatory ophthalmic procedures were performed every year between 2012 and 2014 in the 29 reporting states of the United States. Low-income groups and certain minorities, apart from blacks, having a lower rate of procedure suggest that disparities exist in provision of eye care. The factors leading to these differences need to be further studied in order to devise strategies to provide equitable care. Résumé Objectif Déterminer et comparer les facteurs épidémiologiques, démographiques et socioéconomiques en lien avec les interventions ophtalmologiques aux États-Unis. Participants Toutes les interventions ophtalmologiques réalisées en ambulatoire entre 2012 et 2014. Méthodes Aux fins de la présente analyse, on a eu recours à la SASD (State Ambulatory Surgery Databases), base de données sur les interventions ambulatoires dans 29 états, soit les deux tiers de la population américaine. Ont ainsi été incluses toutes les interventions ophtalmologiques réalisées en ambulatoire entre 2012 et 2014. L'incidence et les données démographiques liées à chaque intervention ont été évaluées dans l'optique d'extraire des statistiques descriptives de façon à faire ressortir les différences clés quant aux données épidémiologiques et aux caractéristiques des patients pour chacune des interventions. Les taux d'interventions représentatifs de la population pour chacun des groupes raciaux ont été calculés d'après les données de recensement à l’échelle nationale. Résultats Au cours des 3 années de l’étude, 3 934 004 interventions ophtalmologiques ont été réalisées, la majorité d'entre elles en mode ambulatoire (98,5 %). Les interventions les plus fréquentes portaient sur l'extraction du cristallin et des cataractes (66,5 %), suivies des interventions intraoculaires (11,4 %) et des interventions touchant les paupières, la cornée et la conjonctive (8,2 %). Le nombre de patients de sexe féminin était plus élevé pour toutes les interventions ambulatoires, à l'exception du traitement des déchirures et décollements de la rétine (patients de sexe masculin : 59,4 %). Le taux de la plupart des interventions était plus élevé chez les sujets noirs comparativement aux sujets caucasiens ou autres, et Medicare était la forme de paiement le plus souvent utilisée. Conclusions Quelque 1,3 million d'interventions ophtalmologiques ambulatoires ont été réalisées chaque année entre 2012 et 2014 dans les 29 états de la base de données SASD aux États-Unis. On a noté que les sujets à faible revenu et certains groupes minoritaires, outre les noirs, ont eu un taux d'intervention plus faible, ce qui dénote des disparités au chapitre des soins oculaires. Il est important d’étudier les facteurs à l'origine de ces différences si l'on souhaite trouver des stratégies pour offrir des soins équitables."],"author":["Usmani, Bushra","Iftikhar, Mustafa","Latif, Asad","Shah, Syed M.

Biannual surveillance for the disease in patients with cirrhosis and in high risk carriers of hepatitis B virus allows early stage cancer detection and treatment with good long term outcomes. Liver ultrasonography and serum α fetoprotein are the most commonly used surveillance tests. If suspicious results are found on the surveillance test, multiphasic computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging should be undertaken to confirm the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. If radiologic tests show inconclusive results, liver biopsy or repeat imaging could be considered for confirmation of hepatocellular carcinoma. Management of the disease is complex. Patients should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team, and the selection of treatment should consider factors such as tumor burden, severity of liver dysfunction, medical comorbidities, local expertise, and preference of patients. Early stage hepatocellular carcinoma is best managed by curative treatment, which includes resection, ablation, or transplantation. Patients with intermediate stage disease often receive locoregional treatment. Systemic treatment is reserved for patients with advanced disease. Several positive, phase III, randomized controlled trials have expanded the systemic treatment options for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with promising long term outcomes, especially trials using combination treatments, which could also have eventual implications for the treatment of earlier stage disease."],"author":["Yang, Ju Dong","Heimbach, Julie K."],"date":["2020-10-26"],"doi":["10.1136/bmj.m3544"],"eprint":["33106289"],"eprinttype":["pubmed"],"issn":["1756-1833"],"journaltitle":["BMJ"],"pages":["m3544"],"publisher":["British Medical Journal Publishing Group"],"shortjournal":["BMJ"],"title":["New advances in the diagnosis and management of hepatocellular carcinoma"],"url":["https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m3544"],"urldate":["2025-06-08"],"volume":["371"],"year":["2020"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Yang","firstName":"Ju Dong"},{"lastName":"Heimbach","firstName":"Julie K."}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"yokoeTokyoGuidelines20182018","type":"article","fields":{"langid":["english"],"abstract":["The Tokyo Guidelines 2013 (TG13) for acute cholangitis and cholecystitis were globally disseminated and various clinical studies about the management of acute cholecystitis were reported by many researchers and clinicians from all over the world. The 1st edition of the Tokyo Guidelines 2007 (TG07) was revised in 2013. According to that revision, the TG13 diagnostic criteria of acute cholecystitis provided better specificity and higher diagnostic accuracy. Thorough our literature search about diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis, new and strong evidence that had been released from 2013 to 2017 was not found with serious and important issues about using TG13 diagnostic criteria of acute cholecystitis. On the other hand, the TG13 severity grading for acute cholecystitis has been validated in numerous studies. As a result of these reviews, the TG13 severity grading for acute cholecystitis was significantly associated with parameters including 30-day overall mortality, length of hospital stay, conversion rates to open surgery, and medical costs. In terms of severity assessment, breakthrough and intensive literature for revising severity grading was not reported. Consequently, TG13 diagnostic criteria and severity grading were judged from numerous validation studies as useful indicators in clinical practice and adopted as TG18/TG13 diagnostic criteria and severity grading of acute cholecystitis without any modification.
