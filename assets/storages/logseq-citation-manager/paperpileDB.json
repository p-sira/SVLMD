Acute cholecystitis is diagnosed in approximately 200 000 people in the US each year.</p><h3>Observations</h3><p>Gallstone-associated cystic duct obstruction is responsible for 90% to 95% of the cases of acute cholecystitis. Approximately 5% to 10% of patients with acute cholecystitis have<i>acalculous cholecystitis</i>, defined as acute inflammation of the gallbladder without gallstones, typically in the setting of severe critical illness. The typical presentation of acute cholecystitis consists of acute right upper quadrant pain, fever, and nausea that may be associated with eating and physical examination findings of right upper quadrant tenderness. Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant has a sensitivity of approximately 81% and a specificity of approximately 83% for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. When an ultrasound result does not provide a definitive diagnosis, hepatobiliary scintigraphy (a nuclear medicine study that includes the intravenous injection of a radiotracer excreted in the bile) is the gold standard diagnostic test. Following diagnosis, early (performed within 1-3 days) vs late (performed after 3 days) laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with improved patient outcomes, including fewer composite postoperative complications (11.8% for early vs 34.4% for late), a shorter length of hospital stay (5.4 days vs 10.0 days), and lower hospital costs. During pregnancy, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy, compared with delayed operative management, is associated with a lower risk of maternal-fetal complications (1.6% for early vs 18.4% for delayed) and is recommended during all trimesters. In people older than 65 years of age, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with lower mortality at 2-year follow-up (15.2%) compared with nonoperative management (29.3%). A percutaneous cholecystostomy tube, in which a drainage catheter is placed in the gallbladder lumen under image guidance, is an effective therapy for patients with an exceptionally high perioperative risk. However, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement in a randomized trial was associated with higher rates of postprocedural complications (65%) compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (12%). For patients with acalculous acute cholecystitis, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube should be reserved for patients who are severely ill at the time of diagnosis; all others should undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Acute cholecystitis, typically due to gallstone obstruction of the cystic duct, affects approximately 200 000 people in the US annually. In most patient populations, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, performed within 3 days of diagnosis, is the first-line therapy for acute cholecystitis.</p>"],"author":["Gallaher, Jared R.","Charles, Anthony"],"date":["2022-03-08"],"doi":["10.1001/jama.2022.2350"],"file":["/home/psira/Zotero/storage/3FSTTBPH/Gallaher and Charles - 2022 - Acute Cholecystitis A Review.pdf"],"issn":["0098-7484"],"journaltitle":["JAMA"],"number":["10"],"pages":["965–975"],"publisher":["American Medical Association"],"shortjournal":["JAMA"],"shorttitle":["Acute Cholecystitis"],"title":["Acute Cholecystitis: A Review"],"url":["https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2789654"],"urldate":["2025-06-07"],"volume":["327"],"year":["2022"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Gallaher","firstName":"Jared R."},{"lastName":"Charles","firstName":"Anthony"}]}},{"key":"goodUltrasonicPropertiesGallstones1979","type":"article","fields":{"author":["Good, L.","Edell, S.","Soloway, R.","Trotman, B.","Mulhern, C.","Arger, P."],"date":["1979-08-01"],"doi":["10.1016/0016-5085(79)90274-9"],"journaltitle":["Gastroenterology"],"pages":["258–263"],"shortjournal":["Gastroenterology"],"title":["Ultrasonic properties of gallstones: Effect of stone size and composition"],"url":["https://consensus.app/papers/ultrasonic-properties-of-gallstones-effect-of-stone-size-good-edell/f73756c95f5a5dada6f21790c1738bea/"],"volume":["77"],"year":["1979-08-01"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Good","firstName":"L."},{"lastName":"Edell","firstName":"S."},{"lastName":"Soloway","firstName":"R."},{"lastName":"Trotman","firstName":"B."},{"lastName":"Mulhern","firstName":"C."},{"lastName":"Arger","firstName":"P."}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"hapcaBiliaryColic2021","type":"article","fields":{"langid":["english"],"abstract":["### What you need to know A 30 year old woman presents to her general practice with abdominal pain. It started suddenly yesterday evening and lasted for a few hours, but then it came on again in the morning. She says it feels like a tight band around her upper abdomen. She had a similar, less painful, episode a few weeks ago which resolved with over-the-counter analgesia. She is otherwise healthy and has intentionally lost 5 kg in the past six weeks. This article outlines how to assess and manage a patient with suspected biliary colic in primary care. Areas covered include criteria for referral, investigations, and discussion of management options. Abdominal pain is a common presenting symptom with many causes, as outlined in box 1. Gallstone pathology is an important differential. Box 2 describes the spectrum of clinical syndromes that can arise from gallstones.

The mainstay of treatment is cholecystectomy, which is commonly associated with physical pain and may also seriously affect a patient’s quality of life. Clinical research suggests that cholelithiasis is closely related to the age, gender, body mass index, and other basic physical characteristics of patients. Clinical research further suggests that the occurrence of cholelithiasis is related to obesity, diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver, and other diseases. For this reason, we reviewed the following: genetic factors; excessive liver cholesterol secretion (causing cholesterol supersaturation in gallbladder bile); accelerated growth of cholesterol crystals and solid cholesterol crystals; gallbladder motility impairment; and cardiovascular factors. Herein, we summarize and analyze the causes and mechanisms of cholelithiasis, discuss its correlation with the pathogenesis of related diseases, and discuss possible mechanisms."],"author":["Sun, Hao","Warren, Jonathan","Yip, James","Ji, Yu","Hao, Shaolong","Han, Wei","Ding, Yuchuan"],"date":["2022-04"],"doi":["10.3390/biom12040550"],"file":["/home/psira/Zotero/storage/MRVHYALB/Sun et al. - 2022 - Factors Influencing Gallstone Formation A Review of the Literature.pdf"],"issn":["2218-273X"],"issue":["4"],"journaltitle":["Biomolecules"],"keywords":["bile acids","cardiovascular disease","diabetes","gallstone disease","non-alcoholic fatty liver","obesity"],"number":["4"],"pages":["550"],"publisher":["Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute"],"shorttitle":["Factors Influencing Gallstone Formation"],"title":["Factors Influencing Gallstone Formation: A Review of the Literature"],"url":["https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/12/4/550"],"urldate":["2025-06-07"],"volume":["12"],"year":["2022"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Sun","firstName":"Hao"},{"lastName":"Warren","firstName":"Jonathan"},{"lastName":"Yip","firstName":"James"},{"lastName":"Ji","firstName":"Yu"},{"lastName":"Hao","firstName":"Shaolong"},{"lastName":"Han","firstName":"Wei"},{"lastName":"Ding","firstName":"Yuchuan"}]}}]
