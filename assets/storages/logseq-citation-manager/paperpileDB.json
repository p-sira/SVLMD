It started suddenly yesterday evening and lasted for a few hours, but then it came on again in the morning. She says it feels like a tight band around her upper abdomen. She had a similar, less painful, episode a few weeks ago which resolved with over-the-counter analgesia. She is otherwise healthy and has intentionally lost 5 kg in the past six weeks. This article outlines how to assess and manage a patient with suspected biliary colic in primary care. Areas covered include criteria for referral, investigations, and discussion of management options. Abdominal pain is a common presenting symptom with many causes, as outlined in box 1. Gallstone pathology is an important differential. Box 2 describes the spectrum of clinical syndromes that can arise from gallstones.

The mainstay of treatment is cholecystectomy, which is commonly associated with physical pain and may also seriously affect a patient's quality of life. Clinical research suggests that cholelithiasis is closely related to the age, gender, body mass index, and other basic physical characteristics of patients. Clinical research further suggests that the occurrence of cholelithiasis is related to obesity, diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver, and other diseases. For this reason, we reviewed the following: genetic factors; excessive liver cholesterol secretion (causing cholesterol supersaturation in gallbladder bile); accelerated growth of cholesterol crystals and solid cholesterol crystals; gallbladder motility impairment; and cardiovascular factors. Herein, we summarize and analyze the causes and mechanisms of cholelithiasis, discuss its correlation with the pathogenesis of related diseases, and discuss possible mechanisms."],"author":["Sun, Hao","Warren, Jonathan","Yip, James","Ji, Yu","Hao, Shaolong","Han, Wei","Ding, Yuchuan"],"copyright":["http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"],"doi":["10.3390/biom12040550"],"file":["/home/psira/Zotero/storage/MRVHYALB/Sun et al. - 2022 - Factors Influencing Gallstone Formation A Review of the Literature.pdf"],"issn":["2218-273X"],"journal":["Biomolecules"],"keywords":["bile acids","cardiovascular disease","diabetes","gallstone disease","non-alcoholic fatty liver","obesity"],"month":["04"],"number":["4"],"pages":["550"],"publisher":["Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute"],"shorttitle":["Factors Influencing Gallstone Formation"],"title":["Factors Influencing Gallstone Formation: A Review of the Literature"],"urldate":["2025-06-07"],"volume":["12"],"year":["2022"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Sun","firstName":"Hao"},{"lastName":"Warren","firstName":"Jonathan"},{"lastName":"Yip","firstName":"James"},{"lastName":"Ji","firstName":"Yu"},{"lastName":"Hao","firstName":"Shaolong"},{"lastName":"Han","firstName":"Wei"},{"lastName":"Ding","firstName":"Yuchuan"}]}}]
