Acute cholecystitis is diagnosed in approximately 200 000 people in the US each year.</p><h3>Observations</h3><p>Gallstone-associated cystic duct obstruction is responsible for 90% to 95% of the cases of acute cholecystitis. Approximately 5% to 10% of patients with acute cholecystitis have<i>acalculous cholecystitis</i>, defined as acute inflammation of the gallbladder without gallstones, typically in the setting of severe critical illness. The typical presentation of acute cholecystitis consists of acute right upper quadrant pain, fever, and nausea that may be associated with eating and physical examination findings of right upper quadrant tenderness. Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant has a sensitivity of approximately 81% and a specificity of approximately 83% for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. When an ultrasound result does not provide a definitive diagnosis, hepatobiliary scintigraphy (a nuclear medicine study that includes the intravenous injection of a radiotracer excreted in the bile) is the gold standard diagnostic test. Following diagnosis, early (performed within 1-3 days) vs late (performed after 3 days) laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with improved patient outcomes, including fewer composite postoperative complications (11.8% for early vs 34.4% for late), a shorter length of hospital stay (5.4 days vs 10.0 days), and lower hospital costs. During pregnancy, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy, compared with delayed operative management, is associated with a lower risk of maternal-fetal complications (1.6% for early vs 18.4% for delayed) and is recommended during all trimesters. In people older than 65 years of age, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with lower mortality at 2-year follow-up (15.2%) compared with nonoperative management (29.3%). A percutaneous cholecystostomy tube, in which a drainage catheter is placed in the gallbladder lumen under image guidance, is an effective therapy for patients with an exceptionally high perioperative risk. However, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement in a randomized trial was associated with higher rates of postprocedural complications (65%) compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (12%). For patients with acalculous acute cholecystitis, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube should be reserved for patients who are severely ill at the time of diagnosis; all others should undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>Acute cholecystitis, typically due to gallstone obstruction of the cystic duct, affects approximately 200 000 people in the US annually. In most patient populations, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, performed within 3 days of diagnosis, is the first-line therapy for acute cholecystitis.</p>"],"author":["Gallaher, Jared R.","Charles, Anthony"],"date":["2022-03-08"],"doi":["10.1001/jama.2022.2350"],"file":["/home/psira/Zotero/storage/3FSTTBPH/Gallaher and Charles - 2022 - Acute Cholecystitis A Review.pdf"],"issn":["0098-7484"],"journaltitle":["JAMA"],"number":["10"],"pages":["965–975"],"publisher":["American Medical Association"],"shortjournal":["JAMA"],"shorttitle":["Acute Cholecystitis"],"title":["Acute Cholecystitis: A Review"],"url":["https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2789654"],"urldate":["2025-06-07"],"volume":["327"],"year":["2022"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Gallaher","firstName":"Jared R."},{"lastName":"Charles","firstName":"Anthony"}]}},{"key":"goodUltrasonicPropertiesGallstones1979","type":"article","fields":{"author":["Good, L.","Edell, S.","Soloway, R.","Trotman, B.","Mulhern, C.","Arger, P."],"date":["1979-08-01"],"doi":["10.1016/0016-5085(79)90274-9"],"journaltitle":["Gastroenterology"],"pages":["258–263"],"shortjournal":["Gastroenterology"],"title":["Ultrasonic properties of gallstones: Effect of stone size and composition"],"url":["https://consensus.app/papers/ultrasonic-properties-of-gallstones-effect-of-stone-size-good-edell/f73756c95f5a5dada6f21790c1738bea/"],"volume":["77"],"year":["1979"]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Good","firstName":"L."},{"lastName":"Edell","firstName":"S."},{"lastName":"Soloway","firstName":"R."},{"lastName":"Trotman","firstName":"B."},{"lastName":"Mulhern","firstName":"C."},{"lastName":"Arger","firstName":"P."}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"hapcaBiliaryColic2021","type":"article","fields":{"langid":["english"],"abstract":["### What you need to know A 30 year old woman presents to her general practice with abdominal pain. It started suddenly yesterday evening and lasted for a few hours, but then it came on again in the morning. She says it feels like a tight band around her upper abdomen. She had a similar, less painful, episode a few weeks ago which resolved with over-the-counter analgesia. She is otherwise healthy and has intentionally lost 5 kg in the past six weeks. This article outlines how to assess and manage a patient with suspected biliary colic in primary care. Areas covered include criteria for referral, investigations, and discussion of management options. Abdominal pain is a common presenting symptom with many causes, as outlined in box 1.

The mainstay of treatment is cholecystectomy, which is commonly associated with physical pain and may also seriously affect a patient’s quality of life. Clinical research suggests that cholelithiasis is closely related to the age, gender, body mass index, and other basic physical characteristics of patients. Clinical research further suggests that the occurrence of cholelithiasis is related to obesity, diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver, and other diseases. For this reason, we reviewed the following: genetic factors; excessive liver cholesterol secretion (causing cholesterol supersaturation in gallbladder bile); accelerated growth of cholesterol crystals and solid cholesterol crystals; gallbladder motility impairment; and cardiovascular factors.

They can result in a number of health problems, including pain, jaundice, infection and acute pancreatitis. A variety of imaging modalities can be employed to identify the condition, while management of confirmed cases of CBDS may involve endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, surgery and radiological methods of stone extraction. Clinicians are therefore confronted with a number of potentially valid options to diagnose and treat individuals with suspected CBDS. The British Society of Gastroenterology first published a guideline on the management of CBDS in 2008. Since then a number of developments in management have occurred along with further systematic reviews of the available evidence. The following recommendations reflect these changes and provide updated guidance to healthcare professionals who are involved in the care of adult patients with suspected or proven CBDS.

The 1st edition of the Tokyo Guidelines 2007 (TG07) was revised in 2013. According to that revision, the TG13 diagnostic criteria of acute cholecystitis provided better specificity and higher diagnostic accuracy. Thorough our literature search about diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis, new and strong evidence that had been released from 2013 to 2017 was not found with serious and important issues about using TG13 diagnostic criteria of acute cholecystitis. On the other hand, the TG13 severity grading for acute cholecystitis has been validated in numerous studies. As a result of these reviews, the TG13 severity grading for acute cholecystitis was significantly associated with parameters including 30-day overall mortality, length of hospital stay, conversion rates to open surgery, and medical costs. In terms of severity assessment, breakthrough and intensive literature for revising severity grading was not reported. Consequently, TG13 diagnostic criteria and severity grading were judged from numerous validation studies as useful indicators in clinical practice and adopted as TG18/TG13 diagnostic criteria and severity grading of acute cholecystitis without any modification.
