  abstract = {Background Common bile duct (CBD) stones may be over looked at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), particularly when intra-operative cholangiography (IOC) is not performed. Currently, there is no data available about the time course and pattern of presentation for stones retained in the CBD at the time of LC. The aim of this study was to establish the time course and pattern of presentation of unsuspected retained CBD stones post LC. Methods Patients presenting with symptomatic CBD stones from 1994 until 2010, having previously undergone LC were studied in this retrospective, case note review. CBD stones were confirmed at ERCP. Data collected included LC date, mode of presentation, imaging results including CBD diameter, stone appearance, length of stay and post ERCP complications. Patients having an ERCP for stones found on IOC at LC were excluded. Results Sixty-one patients met the inclusion criteria. The most common mode of presentation was abdominal pain (n = 38, 62 \%) with (17) or without (21) deranged liver function tests. Nineteen (31 \%) patients presented with clinical complications of the CBD stones: cholangitis (10), acute biliary pancreatitis (6) or obstructive jaundice (3). The CBD was usually mild-to-moderately dilated (8–15 mm) on ultrasound. The median time span from LC to presentation with CBD stones was 4 years (range: 6 days–18 years). Five (8.2 \%) patients had a complication from their ERCP; mild pancreatitis (3), bleed (1) and cholangitis (1). Nineteen (31.1 \%) patients required more than one ERCP to complete stone/stent removal. Conclusions The median time for patients to present with symptomatic CBD stones after LC is 4 years. Patients with retrained stones may remain asymptomatic for many years. A third of the patients presented with potentially serious complications of the retained CBD stone. Future studies for CBD stones after LC need to follow patients for at least 10 years.},

Approximately 5\% to 10\% of patients with acute cholecystitis have\mkbibemph{acalculous cholecystitis}, defined as acute inflammation of the gallbladder without gallstones, typically in the setting of severe critical illness. The typical presentation of acute cholecystitis consists of acute right upper quadrant pain, fever, and nausea that may be associated with eating and physical examination findings of right upper quadrant tenderness. Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant has a sensitivity of approximately 81\% and a specificity of approximately 83\% for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. When an ultrasound result does not provide a definitive diagnosis, hepatobiliary scintigraphy (a nuclear medicine study that includes the intravenous injection of a radiotracer excreted in the bile) is the gold standard diagnostic test. Following diagnosis, early (performed within 1-3 days) vs late (performed after 3 days) laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with improved patient outcomes, including fewer composite postoperative complications (11.8\% for early vs 34.4\% for late), a shorter length of hospital stay (5.4 days vs 10.0 days), and lower hospital costs. During pregnancy, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy, compared with delayed operative management, is associated with a lower risk of maternal-fetal complications (1.6\% for early vs 18.4\% for delayed) and is recommended during all trimesters. In people older than 65 years of age, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with lower mortality at 2-year follow-up (15.2\%) compared with nonoperative management (29.3\%). A percutaneous cholecystostomy tube, in which a drainage catheter is placed in the gallbladder lumen under image guidance, is an effective therapy for patients with an exceptionally high perioperative risk. However, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement in a randomized trial was associated with higher rates of postprocedural complications (65\%) compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (12\%). For patients with acalculous acute cholecystitis, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube should be reserved for patients who are severely ill at the time of diagnosis; all others should undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Conclusions and Relevance{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Acute cholecystitis, typically due to gallstone obstruction of the cystic duct, affects approximately 200 000 people in the US annually.

This review covers the first two. AIDS cholangiopathy recently has been reviewed,171 and PSC is an immunologic entity that has been described elsewhere.4, 139 Acute cholangitis occurs in an infected, usually obstructed biliary system, most often at the level of the common bile duct. The most common cause of obstruction is stones, but other causes include strictures, which form after surgery or endoscopy or which may be secondary to sclerosing cholangitis; cysts; diverticula; congenital abnormalities; choledochoceles; pancreatitis; pancreatic or choledochal neoplasms; parasites (Ascaris, Clonorchis, or Echinococcus spp.); blockage in a drainage tube; or extrinsic compression.* *References 3, 20, 61, 86, 87, 96, 99, 101, 107, 125, 151, 176, 177, 180, 181, 195, 197, 198, 201, 202, 210, 244, 250, 255 The obstruction is usually complete, and, as a result, the infected material is unable to drain adequately.

We analyzed 56 sets of common bile duct gallstones collected over a 10-yr period using infrared and atomic absorption spectroscopy and chemical methods. Twenty-four sets (43\%) of stones were cholesterol stones containing 85.3\% cholesterol, 3.2\% pigment, 0.6\% phosphate, and 1.3\% total calcium. Ten sets (18\%) were black pigment stones containing 36.5\% pigment, 11.4\% cholesterol, 7.6\% carbonate, 3.0\% phosphate, and 6.2\% total calcium. Twenty-two sets (39\%) were brown pigment stones containing 52.7\% pigment, 16.5\% calcium palmitate, 10.1\% cholesterol, 0.4\% phosphate, and 3.4\% total calcium. Most of the 26 stones found at the same time as or within several months after cholecystectomy were either cholesterol (69\%) or black pigment (19\%). In contrast, the majority (59\%) of the 22 common duct stones that were diagnosed greater than or equal to 21 mo after cholecystectomy were brown pigment stones. In conclusion, brown pigment stones are a distinct type of pigment stone characterized by their content of substantial amounts of calcium palmitate. They comprise a significant proportion of common duct stones in this series of United States patients, particularly of those found greater than or equal to 21 mo after cholecystectomy.},

  abstract = {The initial management of patients with suspected acute biliary infection starts with the measurement of vital signs to assess whether or not the situation is urgent. If the case is judged to be urgent, initial medical treatment should be started immediately including respiratory/circulatory management if required, without waiting for a definitive diagnosis. The patient's medical history is then taken; an abdominal examination is performed; blood tests, urinalysis, and diagnostic imaging are carried out; and a diagnosis is made using the diagnostic criteria for cholangitis/cholecystitis. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, initial medical treatment should be started immediately, severity should be assessed according to the severity grading criteria for acute cholangitis/cholecystitis, and the patient's general status should be evaluated. For mild acute cholangitis, in most cases initial treatment including antibiotics is sufficient, and most patients do not require biliary drainage. However, biliary drainage should be considered if a patient does not respond to initial treatment. For moderate acute cholangitis, early endoscopic or percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage is indicated. If the underlying etiology requires treatment, this should be provided after the patient's general condition has improved; endoscopic sphincterotomy and subsequent choledocholithotomy may be performed together with biliary drainage. For severe acute cholangitis, appropriate respiratory/circulatory management is required. Biliary drainage should be performed as soon as possible after the patient's general condition has been improved by initial treatment and respiratory/circulatory management.

  abstract = {Acute cholangitis is a potentially life-threatening systemic disease resulting from a combination of infection and obstruction of the biliary tree, secondary to different underlying etiologies. Common causes of cholangitis (eg, gallstones, benign and malignant biliary strictures) are well known. However, others (eg, immunoglobulin-G subclass-4–related sclerosing cholangitis) have been described only recently, are still under evaluation, and need to gain broader attention from clinicians. The diagnosis of acute cholangitis is based on clinical presentation and laboratory data indicating systemic infection, as well as diagnostic imaging modalities revealing signs of biliary obstruction and possibly an underlying etiology. The clinical presentation varies, and initial risk stratification is important to guide further management. Early medical therapy, including fluid resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic coverage, is of major importance in all cases, followed by a biliary drainage procedure and, if possible, definitive therapy of the underlying etiology. The type and timing of biliary drainage should be based on the severity of the clinical presentation, and the availability and feasibility of drainage techniques, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), and open surgical drainage. ERCP plays a central role in the management of biliary obstruction in patients with acute cholangitis. Endoscopic ultrasound–guided biliary drainage recently emerged as a possible alternative to PTC for second-line therapy if ERCP fails or is not possible.},

  abstract = {Gallstone disease is a common pathology of the digestive system with nearly a 10–20\% incidence rate among adults. The mainstay of treatment is cholecystectomy, which is commonly associated with physical pain and may also seriously affect a patient’s quality of life. Clinical research suggests that cholelithiasis is closely related to the age, gender, body mass index, and other basic physical characteristics of patients. Clinical research further suggests that the occurrence of cholelithiasis is related to obesity, diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver, and other diseases. For this reason, we reviewed the following: genetic factors; excessive liver cholesterol secretion (causing cholesterol supersaturation in gallbladder bile); accelerated growth of cholesterol crystals and solid cholesterol crystals; gallbladder motility impairment; and cardiovascular factors. Herein, we summarize and analyze the causes and mechanisms of cholelithiasis, discuss its correlation with the pathogenesis of related diseases, and discuss possible mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Common bile duct stones (CBDS) are estimated to be present in 10–20\% of individuals with symptomatic gallstones. They can result in a number of health problems, including pain, jaundice, infection and acute pancreatitis. A variety of imaging modalities can be employed to identify the condition, while management of confirmed cases of CBDS may involve endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, surgery and radiological methods of stone extraction. Clinicians are therefore confronted with a number of potentially valid options to diagnose and treat individuals with suspected CBDS. The British Society of Gastroenterology first published a guideline on the management of CBDS in 2008. Since then a number of developments in management have occurred along with further systematic reviews of the available evidence. The following recommendations reflect these changes and provide updated guidance to healthcare professionals who are involved in the care of adult patients with suspected or proven CBDS. It is not a protocol and the recommendations contained within should not replace individual clinical judgement.},

  abstract = {The Tokyo Guidelines 2013 (TG13) for acute cholangitis and cholecystitis were globally disseminated and various clinical studies about the management of acute cholecystitis were reported by many researchers and clinicians from all over the world. The 1st edition of the Tokyo Guidelines 2007 (TG07) was revised in 2013. According to that revision, the TG13 diagnostic criteria of acute cholecystitis provided better specificity and higher diagnostic accuracy. Thorough our literature search about diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis, new and strong evidence that had been released from 2013 to 2017 was not found with serious and important issues about using TG13 diagnostic criteria of acute cholecystitis. On the other hand, the TG13 severity grading for acute cholecystitis has been validated in numerous studies. As a result of these reviews, the TG13 severity grading for acute cholecystitis was significantly associated with parameters including 30-day overall mortality, length of hospital stay, conversion rates to open surgery, and medical costs. In terms of severity assessment, breakthrough and intensive literature for revising severity grading was not reported. Consequently, TG13 diagnostic criteria and severity grading were judged from numerous validation studies as useful indicators in clinical practice and adopted as TG18/TG13 diagnostic criteria and severity grading of acute cholecystitis without any modification. Free full articles and mobile app of TG18 are available at: http://www.jshbps.jp/modules/en/index.php?content\_id=47. Related clinical questions and references are also included.},
