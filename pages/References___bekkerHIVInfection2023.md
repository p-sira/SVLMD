	- The AIDS epidemic has been a global public health issue for more than 40 years and has resulted in ~40 million deaths. AIDS is caused by the retrovirus, HIV-1, which is transmitted via body fluids and secretions. After infection, the virus invades host cells by attaching to CD4 receptors and thereafter one of two major chemokine coreceptors, CCR5 or CXCR4, destroying the host cell, most often a T lymphocyte, as it replicates. If unchecked this can lead to an immune-deficient state and demise over a period of ~2â€“10 years. The discovery and global roll-out of rapid diagnostics and effective antiretroviral therapy led to a large reduction in mortality and morbidity and toÂ an expanding group of individuals requiring lifelong viral suppressive therapy. Viral suppression eliminates sexual transmission of the virus and greatly improves health outcomes. HIV infection, although still stigmatized, is now a chronic and manageable condition. Ultimate epidemic control will require prevention and treatment to be made available, affordable and accessible for all. Furthermore, the focus should be heavily oriented towards long-term well-being, care for multimorbidity and good quality of life. Intense research efforts continue for therapeutic and/or preventive vaccines, novel immunotherapies and a cure.
