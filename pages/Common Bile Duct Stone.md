- **Common bile duct stones (CBDS)**, also known as [[Choledocholithiasis]], are 
  present in 10â€“20% of individuals with symptomatic gallstones and can 
  cause pain, jaundice, infection, and acute pancreatitis [(Williams, 2017)]([[References/williamsUpdatedGuidelineManagement2017]]).
- ## Clinical Presentations
	- [[CBDS]] can present as asymptomatic, [[Biliary Colic]] with [[Juandice]], or [[Cholangitis]].
	-
- ## Types of [[CBDS]]
	- ### Classification by origin [(Liu, 2000)]([[References/liuPathogenesisPresentationCommon2000]])
		- Primary [[CBDS]] (20%) - Originates from the bile ducts
			- Associated with infection or bile stasis
		- Secondary [[CBDS]] (80%) - [[GS]] migrated from the [[GB]]
			- Often cholesterol or black pigmented stones
	- ### Classification by composition [(Malet, 1988)]([[References/maletQuantitativeInfraredSpectroscopy1988]])
		- | Type                | Main Components                                  | Typical Origin      | Key Features                                         |
		  |---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
		  | Cholesterol Stones  | Mostly cholesterol (up to 85%)                   | Usually secondary   | Yellowish, often from [[Gallbladder]]                   |
		  | Black Pigment Stones| Calcium bilirubinate, carbonate, phosphate       | Usually secondary   | Hard, black, associated with hemolysis              |
		  | Brown Pigment Stones| Bilirubinate, calcium palmitate, some cholesterol| Usually primary     | Softer, brown, linked to infection and stasis       |
