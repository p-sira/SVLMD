- **Common bile duct stones (CBDS)**, also known as [[Choledocholithiasis]], are 
  present in 10â€“20% of individuals with symptomatic gallstones and can 
  cause **pain, jaundice, infection, and acute pancreatitis** [(Williams, 2017)]([[References/williamsUpdatedGuidelineManagement2017]]).
- ## Types of [[CBDS]]
  collapsed:: true
	- ### Classification by origin [(Liu, 2000)]([[References/liuPathogenesisPresentationCommon2000]])
		- Primary [[CBDS]] (20%) - Originates from the bile ducts
			- Associated with infection or bile stasis
		- Secondary [[CBDS]] (80%) - [[GS]] migrated from the [[GB]]
			- Often cholesterol or black pigmented stones
	- ### Classification by composition [(Malet, 1988)]([[References/maletQuantitativeInfraredSpectroscopy1988]])
		- | Type                | Main Components                                  | Typical Origin      | Key Features                                         |
		  |---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
		  | Cholesterol Stones  | Mostly cholesterol (up to 85%)                   | Usually secondary   | Yellowish, often from [[Gallbladder]]                   |
		  | Black Pigment Stones| Calcium bilirubinate, carbonate, phosphate       | Usually secondary   | Hard, black, associated with hemolysis              |
		  | Brown Pigment Stones| Bilirubinate, calcium palmitate, some cholesterol| Usually primary     | Softer, brown, linked to infection and stasis       |
	- Other forms: sludge, gravel, foreign body stones
- ## Clinical Presentations
  collapsed:: true
	- [[CBDS]] can present as asymptomatic, [[Biliary Colic]] with [[Juandice]], or [[Cholangitis]] [(Cox, 2015)]([[References/coxTimingNaturePresentation2015]]).
	- ### Common Symptoms
		- [[Abdominal Pain]]
		- [[Juandice]]
		- [[Fever]]
		- [[Nausea and Vomiting]]
	- ### Complications and Severe Presentations
		- [[Cholangitis]]
		- [[Acute Pancreatitis]]
		- [[Obstructive Jaundice]]
	- ### Comparison with [[Cholangiocarcinoma]]
		- **[[CBDS]]**: Intermittent, painful jaundice
		- **[[CCA]]**: Progressive, painless jaundice
			- Painless due to bile duct adaptation
- ## Investigation
	- ### [[ultrasound]]
