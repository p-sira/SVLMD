- About 80% of sphincter-preserving surgery patients experience [[LARS]].
- Short-term symptoms, resolving within 6-12 months after the surgery, are usually due to neorectal irritability, while long-term symptoms are due to permanent changes. Almost 50% of the patients still experience [[LARS]] after over a decade [(Nguyen, 2020)]([[References/nguyenLowAnteriorResection2020]]).
