- **[[Asterixis]]** are a type of movement disorder. The hallmark is a sudden, brief loss of [[Muscle]] tone that causes a **flapping motion**, most commonly observed when the hands are extended [(Nayak, 2012)]([[References/nayakAsterixisFlappingTremors2012]]).
- # Physical Examination
	- Ask the patient to extend their arms and bend their wrists upward ([[Dorsiflexion]])
	- The [[Hands]] will flap downward and return to position in a repeated, irregular fashion, at about 3-5 Hz [(Nayak, 2012)]([[References/nayakAsterixisFlappingTremors2012]]).
- # Associated Conditions
	- **[[Hepatic Encephalopathy]]**
	- Less common:
		- [[Renal Failure]], [[Respiratory Failure]], and various metabolic states or [[Drug Toxicity]]
