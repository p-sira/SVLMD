	- Gallstone formation is influenced by a combination of genetic, metabolic, and lifestyle factors #References/sunFactorsInfluencingGallstone2022.
		- **Genetic predisposition** and family history
		- **[[Obesity]], [[Diabetes]], and [[metabolic syndromes]]**: These conditions disturb cholesterol homeostasis, leading to cholesterol supersaturation in bile.
		- **Age, gender, and body mass index**: Older age and female sex are significant risk factors.
		- **Impaired gallbladder motility** and excessive cholesterol secretion by the liver.
		- **Other factors**: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and rapid weight loss can also increase risk.
- ## Management

		- Expectant management & reassure
		- #Cholecystectomy
			- Absolute indication
				- Risk of #[[Gallbladder Cancer]]
					- #GB polyp > 1 cm
					- #GS > 3 cm
					- #[[Porcelain Gallbladder]]
			- Relative indication
				- Difficulty hospital access
				- Hemolytic diseases
					- Increases risk of #[[Pigmented Gallstone]]
					- Such as #[[Hereditary spherocytosis]], #[[Sickle Cell Anemia]], #[[Thalassemia]]
