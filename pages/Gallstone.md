- **Gallstones** are highly prevalent and the majority are asymptomatic.
- ## Types of Gallstone
	- By pathogenesis and history
		- [[Asymptomatic Gallstone]]
		- [[Symptomatic Gallstone]]
		- [[Acute Cholecystitis]]
			- [[Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis]]
			- [[Acute Calculous Cholecystitis]]
		- [[Mirizzi Syndrome]]
	- By composition
		- [[Cholesterol Gallstone]]
		- [[Pigmented Gallstone]]
		- [[Mixed Gallstone]]
- ## Risk Factors
	- [[Gallstone]] formation is influenced by a combination of genetic, metabolic, and lifestyle factors [(Sun, 2022)]([[References/sunFactorsInfluencingGallstone2022]]).
		- **Genetic predisposition** and family history
		- **[[Obesity]], [[Diabetes]], and [[metabolic syndromes]]**: These conditions disturb cholesterol homeostasis, leading to cholesterol supersaturation in bile.
		- **Age, gender, and body mass index**: Older age and female sex are significant risk factors.
		- **Impaired gallbladder motility** and excessive cholesterol secretion by the liver.
		- **Other factors**: [[Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease]] and rapid weight loss can also increase risk.
	- **Mnemonic: "4 Fs"** - Fatty, Fertile, Female, Fourty
- ## History
	- ### [[Asymptomatic Gallstone]]
		- 1-2% develop symptoms or complications per year.
		- Over a 20-year period, 2/3 remain asymptomatic.
	- ### [[Symptomatic Gallstone]]
		- **[[Biliary Colic]]**
			- {{embed ((6843f8fb-ffa0-44cb-bda4-aaf864cf0518))}}
			- If the symptoms are atypical for [[Biliary Colic]], rule out other causes, such as [[Peptic Ulcer Disease]], [[GERD]], ruptured [[AAA]], and cancers
		- 10-20% develop symptoms or complications per year.
- ## Investigation
	- Ultrasound
		- [[Posterior Acoustic Shadowing]]
			- [[Posterior Acoustic Shadowing]] on [[ultrasound]] is a classic feature of gallstones. **This shadowing is most commonly produced by gallstones that are larger than 3â€“4 mm in diameter, regardless of their composition.** The shadowing occurs because the stone 
			  strongly reflects and absorbs the [[ultrasound]] waves, preventing them from passing through and creating a dark area behind the stone on the image [(Good, 1979)]([[References/goodUltrasonicPropertiesGallstones1979]]).
- ## Management
	- ### [[Asymptomatic gallstone]]
		- Expectant management & reassuring
		- Cholecystectomy
			- Absolute indication
				- Risk of [[Gallbladder Cancer]]
					- [[GB]] polyp > 1 cm
					- [[GS]] > 3 cm
					- [[Porcelain Gallbladder]]
			- Relative indication
				- Difficulty hospital access
				- Hemolytic diseases
					- Increases risk of [[Pigmented Gallstone]]
					- Such as [[Hereditary spherocytosis]], [[Sickle Cell Anemia]], [[Thalassemia]]
	- [[Symptomatic Gallstone]]
		- Elective [[Cholecystectomy]]
		- Avoid fatty and large meal while awaiting [[Surgery]]
