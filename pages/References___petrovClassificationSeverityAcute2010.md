	- There is an ongoing effort to revise the 1992 Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis in the light of emerging evidence. The categorization of the severity of acute pancreatitis is one of the key elements of the classification. This paper aims to define the optimal number of categories and provide their definitions on sound clinical grounds.
