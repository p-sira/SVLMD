	- Aims of this study were to determine the normal range of absolute and relative Hertel exophthalmometric values (EVs) in a Chinese Han population. This population-based cross-sectional study consisted of 2010 healthy Han Chinese (1051 females and 959 males) aged between 8â€“87 years living in Shenyang, Northeast China, including 515 children (aged 8â€“14 years), 517 teenagers (aged 15â€“19 years), 582 adults (aged 20â€“69 years) and 396 elderly (aged 70â€“87 years). A Hertel exophthalmometer was used by the same physician for the measurement of EV and inter-orbital distance (IOD). For the entire study population, the Hertel EVs ranged from 10>mm to 22>mm; the mean EVs for the left eye (OS) and right eye (OD) were 15.0 Â± 1.9>mm and 15.0 Â± 2.0>mm, respectively; the upper normal limits of the EVs (mean + 2 SD) for OS and OD were 18.8>mm and 19.0>mm, respectively; the mean relative EV was 0.20 Â± 0.43>mm. Age, but not sex, had a significant effect on the EV. We concluded that our study provides normative ophthalmic data in a Chinese Han population. The normal EVs, asymmetry and IOD values have been established for clinical reference.
