	- Background: Polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), such as MTHFR C677T and A1298C, are associated with several cancers. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of MTHFR polymorphisms on colon cancer risk and possible interactions with environmental factors in a population from northeastern Thailand.Methods: This hospital-based caseâ€“control study was conducted during 2002â€“2006; 130 colon cancer cases and 130 age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled. Information was collected and blood samples were obtained for assay of MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques. Associations between variables of interest and colon cancer were assessed using conditional logistic regression.Results: Increased risk of colon cancer was associated with alcohol consumption and bowel habits. Alcohol drinkers who consumed â‰¤0.50 or >0.50 units of alcohol per day had elevated risks (ORadj = 3.5; 95% CI: 1.19â€“10.25 and ORadj = 1.71; 95% CI: 0.74â€“3.96, respectively). The risk was also higher in subjects with frequent constipation (11.69; 2.18â€“62.79) and occasional constipation (3.43; 1.72â€“6.82). An interaction was observed between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and freshwater fish consumption on colon cancer risk (P value for interaction = 0.031). Interactions were observed between the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and bowel habits, family history of cancer, alcohol consumption, and beef consumption on colon cancer risk (P-value for interaction = 0.0005, 0.007, 0.067, 0.003, respectively).Conclusions: In a Thai population, colon cancer risk was associated with alcohol and beef consumption, bowel habits, and family history of cancer. Interactions between MTHFR polymorphisms and environmental factors were also observed.
