- **[[Acute Cholangitis]]** is a potentially life-threatening **infection of the biliary tree**, most often resulting from **biliary obstruction** due to [[Gallstones]], benign or malignant strictures, or less commonly, other causes such as cysts, neoplasms, or [[Parasites]].
- The obstruction leads to stasis and subsequent infection, with increased intraductal pressure potentially causing [[bacteremia]] and [[Septic Shock]].
- ## Pathophysiology
	- Bile duct infection leads to [(An, 2021)]([[References/anAcuteCholangitisCauses2021]]):
		- Bile duct **obstruction** -> [[Juandice]]

		  background-color:: green
		- **[[Bacteremia]]** -> [[Fever with Chills]]
		  background-color:: green
		- **[[Septic Shock]]** -> [[Hypotension]], [[Alteration of Consciousness]]
