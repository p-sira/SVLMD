- Acute cholangitis is a potentially life-threatening infection of the 
  biliary tree, most often resulting from biliary obstruction due to 
  gallstones, benign or malignant strictures, or less commonly, other 
  causes such as cysts, neoplasms, or parasites.
   The obstruction leads to stasis and subsequent infection, with 
  increased intraductal pressure potentially causing bacteremia and septic
   shock.
