- **[[Acute Cholangitis]]** is a potentially life-threatening **infection of the biliary tree**, most often resulting from **biliary obstruction** due to [[Gallstones]], benign or malignant strictures, or less commonly, other causes such as cysts, neoplasms, or [[Parasites]].
- The obstruction leads to stasis and subsequent infection, with increased intraductal pressure potentially causing [[bacteremia]] and [[Septic Shock]].
- ## Pathophysiology
	- Bile duct infection leads to [(An, 2021)]([[References/anAcuteCholangitisCauses2021]]):
		- Bile duct **obstruction** -> [[Juandice]]
		  background-color:: green
		- Bile duct **inflammation** -> [[RUQ Pain]] without [[Murphy Sign]]
		  background-color:: green
		- **[[Bacteremia]]** -> [[Fever with Chills]]
		  background-color:: green
		- **[[Septic Shock]]** -> [[Hypotension]], [[Alteration of Consciousness]]
		- The three symptoms highlighted in green are called the **[[Charcot Triad]]**.
		- All of the symptoms above combined are called the **[[Reynold Pentad]]**.
- ## Diagnosis
	- The **[[Tokyo Guidelines 2018]]** is used for [[Acute Cholangitis]] diagnosis.

	- ### Criteria
		- **Suspected**: 1 systemic sign + 1 [[Cholestasis]] sign
		- **Definite**: 1 systemic sign + 1 cholestasis sign + 1 image finding
	- ### Systemic Signs of [[Inflammation]]
		- [[Fever]] with or without [[Rigors]]
		- Elevated [[CRP]]
		- Elevated [[WBC]] (WBC > 10,000) or depressed WBC (WBC < 4,000)
	- ### Signs of [[Cholestasis]]
		- [[Jaundice]]
		-
	- ### Imaging Findings Characteristic of Acute Cholecystitis
		- According to [(Yokoe, 2018)]([[References/yokoeTokyoGuidelines20182018]]), the accepted imaging findings of acute cholecystitis are:
			- **Thickening** of the gallbladder wall (≥4 mm)
			- **Enlargement** of the gallbladder (long axis ≥8 cm, short axis ≥4 cm)
			- **Gallstones** or retained debris
			- **Fluid accumulation** around the gallbladder
			- **Linear shadows** in the fatty tissue around the gallbladder
- ## Management
	- The management of [[acute cholangitis]] can be divided into two parts:
		- **Treating the obstruction** - [[CBDS]] removal + Biliary drainage

		- **Treating the infection** - [[ATB]] therapy (mostly [[Gram-negative Bacteria]] )
