- **[[Acute Cholangitis]]** is a potentially life-threatening **infection of the biliary tree**, most often resulting from **biliary obstruction** due to [[Gallstones]], benign or malignant strictures, or less commonly, other causes such as cysts, neoplasms, or [[Parasites]].
- The obstruction leads to stasis and subsequent infection, with increased intraductal pressure potentially causing [[bacteremia]] and [[Septic Shock]].
- ## Pathophysiology
	- Bile duct infection leads to:
		- Bile duct **obstruction** -> [[Juandice]]
		- Bile duct **inflammation** -> [[RUQ Pain]] without [[Murphy Sign]]
		- **[[Bacteremia]]** -> [[Fever with Chills]]
