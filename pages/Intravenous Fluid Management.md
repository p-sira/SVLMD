- # Choice of Fluid
	- ## [[Crystalloid Fluid]]
		- Saline solution
		- Balanced crystalloids
			- [[Ringer's Lactate]]
			- [[Ringer's Acetate]]
		- Isotonic balanced crystalloids
			- [[Plasma-Lyte]]
			- [[Sterofundin]]
	- ## [[Colloid Fluid]]
		- [[Gelatin]]
		- [[Hydroxyethyl Starch]]
		- [[Albumin]]
- # Amount of Fluid
	- The amount of [[IV Fluid]] consists of three components: **maintenance**, **deficits**, and **concurrent loss**.
	- $$M + D + C$$
	- ## [[Maintenance Fluid]]
		- Normal daily fluid and electrolyte needed to support basic physiological functions.

	- ## Deficits
		- Replaces fluids lost before presentation, such as from dehydration due to vomiting, diarrhea, or fasting.
		- Calculated based on the [[Degree of Dehydration]].
		- Administer [[Resuscitation Fluid]] if the [[Degree of Dehydration]] is severe or moderate-severe.
			- Use [[Isotonic Fluid]] ([[NSS]], [[Acetar]], [[Ringer's Lactate]])
			- Volume: 10-20 mL/kg/dose
			- Rate
				- Severe: within 15-30 mins
				- Moderate: within 1 hr
	- ## Concurrent Loss
		- Ongoing abnormal fluid losses that continue during treatment, such as from burns and operative blood loss
		- ### Insensible Loss
			- Fluid lost through processes that are hard to measure, e.g., [[Perspiration]]
		- ### Sensible Loss
			- Measurable fluid loss, e.g., blood loss
		- ### Third Space Loss
			- Fluid shift to hard-to-measure body compartments
