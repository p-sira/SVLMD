- # Choice of Fluid
	- ## [[Crystalloid Fluid]] #card
		- Saline solution
		- Balanced crystalloids
			- [[Ringer's Lactate]]
			- [[Ringer's Acetate]]
		- Isotonic balanced crystalloids
			- [[Plasma-Lyte]]
			- [[Sterofundin]]
	- ## [[Colloid Fluid]] #card
		- [[Gelatin]]
		- [[Hydroxyethyl Starch]]
		- [[Albumin]]
- # Amount of Fluid
	- The amount of [[IV Fluid]] consists of three components: **maintenance**, **deficits**, and **concurrent loss**.
	- $$M + D + C$$
	- ## [[Maintenance Fluid]] #card
		- Normal daily fluid and electrolyte needed to support basic physiological functions.

	- ## Deficits
		- **Fluids lost before presentation**, such as from dehydration due to vomiting, diarrhea, or fasting.
		- Calculated based on the **[[Degree of Dehydration]]** or the **[[ATLS Classification]]**.
		- Administer [[Resuscitation Fluid]] if the [[Degree of Dehydration]] is severe or moderate-severe.
			- Use [[Isotonic Fluid]] ([[NSS]], [[Acetar]], [[Ringer's Lactate]])
			- Volume: 10-20 mL/kg/dose
			- Rate
				- Severe: within 15-30 mins
				- Moderate: within 1 hr
		- ### [[NPO]]
			- Replacement for [[NPO]] at midnight is controversial.
			- $$D_{NPO} = M_{per\ hr} * hour_{NPO}$$
			- Replace 50% of the deficit volume within the first hour. 25% in the second and third.
	- ## Concurrent Loss
		- Ongoing abnormal fluid losses that continue during treatment, such as from burns and operative blood loss.
		- ### Insensible Loss
			- Fluid lost through processes that are **hard to measure**, e.g., [[Perspiration]]
		- ### Sensible Loss
			- **Measurable** fluid loss, e.g., blood loss
		- ### Third Space Loss
			- **Fluid shift** to hard-to-measure body compartments
			- Intervention is often not perform routinely in clinical practice.
				- Historically, concurrent loss is replaced routinely using this approximation.
				- |Degree of Tissue Trauma|mL/kg/hr|
				  |--|--|
				  |Minimal (herniorrhaphy)|0-2|
				  |Moderate (cholecystectomy)|2-4|
				  |Severe (bowel resection)|4-8|
