- # Abstract
  heading:: 1
	- The human eye is a relatively simple optical instrument. This limits the quality of the retinal image affecting vision. However, the neural circuitry seems to be exquisitely designed to match the otherwise limited optical capabilities, providing an exceptional quality of vision. In this tutorial article, the main characteristics of the eyeâ€™s geometry and optics will first be reviewed. Then, their impact on vision under a variety of normal conditions will be discussed. The information gathered here should serve both those readers interested in basic vision and physiological optics and those more interested in related applications.
