	- Abstract This research examined the relationship between colon cancer risks and pollution in various areas of Thailand, using satellites to gather quantities of aerosols in the atmosphere. Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model and the Poisson log-linear model were used to examine the incidence rates of colon cancer standardized by national references; from the database of the National Health Security Office, Ministry of Public Health of Thailand and NASAâ€™s database from aerosol diagnostics model. Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) was used to explore disease-gender-specific spatio-temporal patterns of colon cancer incidences and accumulated air pollution-related cancers in Thailand between 2010 and 2016. A total of 59,605 patients were selected for the study. Due to concerns regarding statistical reliability between aerosol diagnostics model and colon cancer incidences, the posterior probabilities of risk appeared the most in dust PM 2.5 . It could be interpreted as relative risk in every increase of 10Â Î¼g/m 3 in black carbon, organic carbon, and dust-PM 2.5 levels were associated respectively with an increase of 4%, 4%, and 15% in the risks of colon cancer. A significant increase in the incidence of colon cancer with accumulated ambient air quality raised concerns regarding the prevention of air pollution. This study utilized data based on the incidences of colon cancer; the countryâ€™s database and linked cancer data to pollution. According to the database from NASAâ€™s technology, this research has never been conducted in Thailand.
