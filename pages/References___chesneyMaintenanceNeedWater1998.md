  heading:: 1
	- In the category of genitourinary and fluid and electrolyte disorders, no paper bridges the discoveries of the 1930s through the 1950s and the practice of today as does the classic paper of Holliday and Segar.1 Today house officers and staff physicians use this same simple method for estimating insensible and urinary water losses of a child or adult of any size or age. Current textbooks and the latest editions of commonly used house officer manuals use this method of determining maintenance water needs based on calorie expenditure.2-5 This method involves a simple formula that relates the average calorie expenditure of a child to his/her weight in kg.
