- ## [[R-Ratio]]
	- Online calculator: https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/4064/r-factor-liver-injury
	- $$\frac{ALT_{pt/ul}}{ALP_{pt/ul}}$$
	- The [[R-Ratio]] is calculated by dividing the ratio of [[ALT]] to its upper limit of normal (ULN) by the ratio of [[ALP]] to its ULN
	- ### Interpretation
		- **R > 5:** Hepatocellular pattern (liver cell injury)
		- **R < 2**: Cholestatic pattern (bile flow obstruction)
