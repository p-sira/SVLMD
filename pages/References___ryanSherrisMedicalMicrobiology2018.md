  heading:: 1
	- With this seventh edition, Sherris Medical Microbiology will complete its fourth decade. We are pleased to welcome new authors, Andy Alspaugh (mycology) and Megan Reller (epidemiology) from Duke and Scott Weissman (bacteriology) from the University of Washington. Sadly, George Ray a founding author and coeditor of the last three editions is no longer with us (see Dedication). John Sherris, the founding editor, continues to act as an inspiration to all of us
