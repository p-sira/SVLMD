- Abstract
	- Common bile duct stones are generally classified as primary or secondary stones based on the locations of origin. The vast majority of the stones found in the biliary tree are secondary stones. The current review discusses the pathogenesis and presentations of primary and secondary biliary stones. Based on discussion of disease pathogenesis and presentation, recommendations for the evaluation and management of common and uncommon disease processes associated with choledocholithiasis are proposed.
