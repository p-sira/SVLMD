	- OBJECTIVESâ€”Diabetes mellitus (DM) has been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). The American College of Gastroenterology Guidelines for Colorectal Cancer Screening 2008 recommend that clinicians be aware of an increased CRC risk in patients with smoking and obesity, but do not highlight the increase in CRC risk in patients with DM. To provide an updated quantitative assessment of the association of DM with colon cancer (CC) and rectal cancer (RC), we conducted a meta-analysis of caseâ€“control and cohort studies. We also evaluated whether the association varied by sex, and assessed potential confounders including obesity, smoking, and exercise.
