## Pathophysiology
	- According to [(Gallaher, 2022)]([[References/gallaherAcuteCholecystitisReview2022]]),
	- Cystic duct obstruction -> Intraluminal pressure -> Inflammatory response -> Secondary bacterial infection
		- [[Acute calculous cholecystitis]] occurs after a **cystic duct obstruction** caused by **gallstones**, sludge, or lithogenic bile.
		- The **degree and duration** of the cystic duct obstruction determine the **progression rate to acute cholecystitis** and the **severity** of gallbladder inflammation.
		- Secondary bacterial infections occur in 20% of [[Acute Cholecystitis]] patients. Causal agents are usually enteric organisms, commonly *[[Escherichia coli]]*, *[[Klebsiella]],* and *[[Enterococcus faecalis]]*.
	- [[AC]] progresses in 3 phases.
		- **First phase: Inflammation** (2-4 days after symptom onset) - [[Gallbladder]] wall congestion and edema

		- **Second phase: Hemorrhage and necrosis of the [[Gallbladder]] wall** (3-5 days) - may cause to [[Gallbladder Perforation]] at the site of [[Ischemic Gangrene]], leading to subsequent biliary peritonitis.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- **Third phase: Chronic or purulent** (after 6 days) - [[Leukocyte]] infiltration, necrotic tissue, and suppuration along with 
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  intraluminal pus and gross infection.
	- After the acute phase, intraluminal pus is replaced with granulation tissue and eventually progresses to [[Chronic Cholecystitis]].
