## Pathophysiology
	- According to [(Gallaher, 2022)]([[References/gallaherAcuteCholecystitisReview2022]]),
	- Cystic duct obstruction -> Intraluminal pressure -> Inflammatory response -> Secondary bacterial infection
		- [[Acute calculous cholecystitis]] occurs after a **cystic duct obstruction** caused by **gallstones**, sludge, or lithogenic bile.
		- The **degree and duration** of the cystic duct obstruction determine the **progression rate to acute cholecystitis** and the **severity** of gallbladder inflammation.
		- Secondary bacterial infections occur in 20% of [[Acute Cholecystitis]] patients. Causal agents are usually enteric organisms, commonly *[[Escherichia coli]]*, *[[Klebsiella]],* and *[[Enterococcus faecalis]]*.
	- [[AC]] progresses in 3 phases.
		- **First phase: Inflammation** - [[Gallbladder]] wall congestion and edema

	- Acute cholecystitis progresses in 3 distinct phases 
	  after a cystic duct obstruction. The first phase is characterized by 
	  inflammation and is manifest by gallbladder wall congestion and edema 
	  (occurs 2-4 days after the onset of symptoms). The second phase is 
	  characterized by hemorrhage and necrosis of the gallbladder wall, which 
	  may lead to gallbladder perforation at the site of ischemic gangrene and
	  subsequent biliary peritonitis (occurs 3-5 days after symptom onset). 
	  The third phase, the chronic or purulent phase, is characterized by 
	  leukocyte infiltration, necrotic tissue, and suppuration along with 
	  intraluminal pus and gross infection (occurs on day 6 or later after 
	  symptom onset) ([Figure](https://jamanetwork-com.ejournal.mahidol.ac.th/journals/jama/fullarticle/2789654#jrv220005f1)).
