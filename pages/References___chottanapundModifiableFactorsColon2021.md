	- To demonstrate the possible impact of modifiable factors on colon cancer development in Thai population, we conducted this case-control study from June 2016 until June 2017. The study was conducted in 11 Thai provincial hospitals. The hospitals in this study were selected by stratification by regions. Patients included 504 ones who were newly diagnosed with colon cancer within 1 month. In the control group, 997 health individuals were enrolled. Both case and control were adjusted by age. The results of this study showed that age and socioeconomic factors were associated with colon cancer risk. In addition, it was found that family history of colon cancer had very high association with colon cancer risk. Behavioral factors, including smoking, inadequate physical exercise, and salty food consumption were associated with colon cancer. We detected no association between obesity, alcohol consumption, and colon cancer. The results suggested that colon cancer might have higher association with genetic factors than behavioral factors among Thai patients. Based on the results of this study, stop smoking and promote adequate physical activity are suggested to reduce the incidence of colon cancrr among Thai patients.
