- **Mirizzi syndrome** is a rare complication of chronic gallstone disease.
	- <1% incidence in developed countries.
	- 4.7-5.7% in underdeveloped countries.
- It involves **extrinsic compression** or erosion of the bile duct due to an **impacted gallstone** in the gallbladder neck or cystic duct.
- The condition can evolve into **[[Cholecystocholedochal]]** or **[[Cholecystoenteric Fistulas]]** [(Beltran, 2012)]([[References/beltraMirizziSyndromeHistory2012]]).
-
- ## Pathophysiology
- Gallstone impaction ➝ Inflammation ➝ External bile duct compression ➝ Erosion ➝ Fistula formation.
- Key anatomical factors: long/short cystic duct variants, atrophic gallbladder, obliterated duct.
-
- ## Clinical Presentation
- **Symptoms:** [[Obstructive Jaundice]] (60–100%), [[RUQ]] pain (50–100%), [[Fever]].
- **Labs:** Elevated [[Bilirubin]], [[Liver Enzymes]], [[CA19-9]] (can mimic malignancy).
- **Risk:** Often misdiagnosed as gallbladder or biliary tract cancer.
-
- ## Investigation
	- ### [[Ultrasonography]]
		- Impacted [[GS]] at [[Cystic Duct]]
		- Dilated [[IHD]]
-
- ## Diagnosis
  
  | Modality | Role |
  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
  | **Ultrasound** | Low sensitivity (8–27%) |
  | **CT** | Rules out malignancy |
  | **MRCP** | Visualizes compression and fistulas |
  | **ERCP** | Diagnostic & therapeutic (55–90% accuracy) |
  | **Intraoperative** | Often first definitive diagnosis (50% of cases) |
