- **Mirizzi syndrome** is a rare complication of chronic gallstone disease.
	- <1% incidence in developed countries.
	- 4.7-5.7% in underdeveloped countries.
- It involves **extrinsic compression** or erosion of the bile duct due to an **impacted gallstone** in the gallbladder neck or cystic duct.
- The condition can evolve into **[[Cholecystocholedochal]]** or **[[Cholecystoenteric Fistulas]]**[(Beltran, Sep)]([[References/beltraMirizziSyndromeHistory2012]])
- ## 👨‍⚕️ Pablo Luis Mirizzi
- Argentinian surgeon (1893–1964) who described the syndrome in 1940.
- Known for pioneering **operative cholangiography** in 1931.
- He originally proposed a **functional obstruction** due to sphincteric spasm—later found inaccurate.

- ## 🧠 Pathophysiology
- Starts with gallstone impaction ➝ inflammation ➝ external bile duct compression ➝ erosion ➝ fistula formation.
- Key anatomical factors: long/short cystic duct variants, atrophic gallbladder, obliterated duct.

- ## 🧪 Clinical Features
- **Symptoms:** Obstructive jaundice (60–100%), RUQ pain (50–100%), fever.
- **Labs:** Elevated bilirubin, liver enzymes, CA19-9 (can mimic malignancy).
- **Risk:** Often misdiagnosed as gallbladder or biliary tract cancer.

- ## 🧍Diagnosis
  
  | Modality | Role |
  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
  | **Ultrasound** | Low sensitivity (8–27%) |
  | **CT** | Rules out malignancy |
  | **MRCP** | Visualizes compression and fistulas |
  | **ERCP** | Diagnostic & therapeutic (55–90% accuracy) |
  | **Intraoperative** | Often first definitive diagnosis (50% of cases) |
