# Setup
This document notes how SVLMD is setup. 

## Citation
SVLMD uses [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), [Better Bibtex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/), and [Logseq Citation Manager](https://github.com/sawhney17/logseq-citation-manager/) to handle citations.

1. Add postscript to Better Bibtex by going to Zotero > Edit > Settings > Better Bibtex
```
// Simple year extraction
if (Translator.BetterBibLaTeX) {
    if (zotero.date) {
        tex.add({name: 'year', value: zotero.date.split(/[//\s]/)[0]})
    }
}
```
This script extracts the year from date field, which will be needed due to how we setup SVLMD to work with Logseq Citation Manager.

2. Export `references.bib` to [../assets/storages/logseq-citation-manager/references.bib] as Better BibLaTex via Zotero, and set to keep it updated.

3. Make sure to import the Logseq Citation Manager settings.
